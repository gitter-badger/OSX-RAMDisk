Need really fast Java IDE or browser? Then keep reading.

This app will create a [RAM disk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAM_drive) in OS-X with specified size to
store apps cache in RAM, which is known as SSD optimization - reducing disk IO or making browsing the web and
programming using IntelliJ more enjoyable.

Supported apps (you can add yours):

* [IntelliJ Idea 14] (https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)
* [Google Chrome] (https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95346?hl=en)
* [Google Canary] (https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/canary.html)
* Safari
* iTunes
* [Android studio] (http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)
* [WebShtorm] (https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/)
* your_app_goes_here

The IntelliJ Idea is really fast after this. Be warned that for large projects you will
need to have larger RAM Disk. I don't have exact numbers, sorry.

If you observing performance degradation - revise how much memory you are using and may be adding more can help.
By default script will create disk of 1/4 of your RAM .
If you need to change the size - edit startupRAMDiskandCacheMover.sh
